- [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com/)
  This is my online domain where I work to understand the world of the Application Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs. A way of sharing data using the web that is touching almost every aspect of our increasingly digital lives, providing access to the bits and bytes that make our personal and professional worlds go round.
